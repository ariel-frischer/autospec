feature:
  branch: "071-auto-commit-flag"
  created: "2025-12-21"
  status: "Draft"
  input: "lets add a new configuration option + -- flag to all workflow run commands that injects more instructions into the agent - the instructions will be clear and concise - to create a commit at the end of the session - 1. Run:  2. determine for any untracked files/folders if they should be added to .gitignore - if so add them 3. Git add all files that should be version tracked (dont add tmp files for example, node_modules, etc...) 4. remove any files that were temporary for this session (clean up house) 5. Create a git commit message in conventional commit format."

edge_cases:
  - scenario: "No changes to commit after workflow completes"
    expected_behavior: "Agent reports no changes to commit, skips commit creation gracefully"
  - scenario: "Git repository is in detached HEAD state"
    expected_behavior: "Agent warns user and skips commit creation to avoid complications"
  - scenario: ".gitignore file doesn't exist"
    expected_behavior: "Agent creates .gitignore with identified patterns if needed"
  - scenario: "Conflict between --auto-commit flag and --no-auto-commit flag"
    expected_behavior: "CLI rejects command with clear error message about conflicting flags"
  - scenario: "User has uncommitted changes before workflow starts"
    expected_behavior: "Auto-commit includes all changes (pre-existing and new) in the commit"
  - scenario: "Git is not initialized in the working directory"
    expected_behavior: "Agent skips commit workflow and warns user that git is not available"

assumptions:
  - "Git is available and the working directory is within a git repository"
  - "The agent (Claude, Gemini, etc.) can execute git commands as part of its workflow"
  - "Conventional commit format follows: type(scope): description (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore)"
  - "Common ignorable patterns include: node_modules, __pycache__, .tmp, dist, build, .env.local, .DS_Store, *.log"
  - "The instructions are appended to the existing agent prompt without modifying core workflow behavior"
  - "Temporary session files are identifiable by convention or location (e.g., /tmp, .autospec-tmp)"

constraints:
  - "Must not modify existing command behavior when auto-commit is disabled"
  - "Must maintain backwards compatibility with existing configs"
  - "Instructions must be agent-agnostic (work with Claude, Gemini, and other supported agents)"
  - "Must not interfere with existing git hooks or commit workflows the user may have configured"

out_of_scope:
  - "Automatic push to remote repository after commit"
  - "Interactive commit message editing or confirmation prompts"
  - "Support for non-git version control systems"
  - "Automatic merge conflict resolution"
  - "Custom .gitignore pattern configuration beyond common defaults"
  - "Commit signing (GPG/SSH)"
  - "Branch management or switching"
